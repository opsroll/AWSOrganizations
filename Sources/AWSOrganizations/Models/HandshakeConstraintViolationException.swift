/** &lt;p&gt;The requested operation would violate the constraint identified in the reason code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;note&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the reasons in the following list might not be applicable to this specific API or operation:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;ACCOUNT_NUMBER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the limit on the number of accounts in an organization. &lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: deleted and closed accounts still count toward your limit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;important&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization or that you can\&quot;t add an account because your organization is still initializing, please contact &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/\&quot;&gt; AWS Customer Support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/important&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;HANDSHAKE_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to exceed the number of handshakes you can send in one day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALREADY_IN_AN_ORGANIZATION: The handshake request is invalid because the invited account is already a member of an organization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;ORGANIZATION_ALREADY_HAS_ALL_FEATURES: The handshake request is invalid because the organization has already enabled all features.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;INVITE_DISABLED_DURING_ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES: You cannot issue new invitations to join an organization while it is in the process of enabling all features. You can resume inviting accounts after you finalize the process when all accounts have agreed to the change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT_REQUIRED: You cannot complete the operation with an account that does not have a payment instrument, such as a credit card, associated with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;ORGANIZATION_FROM_DIFFERENT_SELLER_OF_RECORD: The request failed because the account is from a different marketplace than the accounts in the organization. For example, accounts with India addresses must be associated with the AISPL marketplace. All accounts in an organization must be from the same marketplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;ORGANIZATION_MEMBERSHIP_CHANGE_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted to change the membership of an account too quickly after its previous change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; */
